        <h2>The Three Musketrees of HTML Elements</h2>
        <ol class="elements">
            <li><strong>The Opening Tag:</strong> This is where the element begins. It signals the start of an HTML element and defines its type. It's always enclosed in angle brackets, like &lt;p&gt; for a paragraph.</li>
            <li><strong>The Content:</strong>This is the main part of the element. It's the actual information that will be displayed on the webpage. The content can be text, images, or even other HTML elements.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Closing Tag:</strong>This indicates the end of the element. It tells the browser where the element's content stops. It's similar to the opening tag but includes a forward slash, like<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</li>
        </ol>
