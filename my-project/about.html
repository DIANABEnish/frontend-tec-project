<p class="opening">Hey There! I'm Diana.</p>    
   <p>If I had to sum myself up in one line, I'd say I'm a growing web developer with a passion for creativity and design.</p> 
  <p>Currently, I'm spending my days as a second-year Computer Science student at The Open University of Israel. But here's the thing - my learning doesn't stop when class does.</p>
 <p>I'm always on the hunt for ways to expand my knowledge, whether it's through online courses, podcasts, or just tinkering with code in my free time.</p>
   <p>What really gets me excited is the ability to create digital experiences that catch the eye. That's why I fell in love with web development - it's the perfect place to blend my love for technology with my passion for creation and design.</p> 
   <p>Right now, I'm focusing mainly on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I believe these tools give me the power to turn ideas into stunning web experiences.</p>
   <p>So, if you're looking for someone who can chat about CSS grids, get excited about JavaScript animations, or just dream up the next cool website they're going to build - you've come to the right place!</p>
